            <h4 class="title">What is java?</h4>
            <p id="intro">Java was first developed by James Gosling of Sun company (acquired by Oracle) in the early
                1990s. It was
                originally named oak, aiming at the embedded application of small household appliances. However, the
                market did not respond. No one would have expected the rise of the Internet to bring oak back to life?
                Sun
                company transformed oak and officially released it under the name of Java in 1995. The reason is that
                oak has been registered, so sun has registered the trademark of Java. With the rapid development of
                Internet, Java has become the most important network programming language.</p>
            <p>
                It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled
                Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[17] Java
                applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM)
                regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it
                has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular
                programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client-server web
                applications, with a reported 9 million developers(source: wikipiki).
            </p>
            <img src="assets/img/java-language.jpg" alt="" width="500px" height="400px">

            <p id="versions">As the rapid development of java, SUN later published three different versions of java:</p>
            <div class="li">
                <li>
                    Java SE：Standard Edition
                </li>
                <li> Java EE：Enterprise Edition</li>
                <li> Java ME：Micro Edition</li>
            </div>
            <p>In short, Java SE is the Standard Version, including the standard JVM and standard library, while Java EE
                is the enterprise version. It just adds a large number of APIs and libraries on the basis of Java SE, so
                as to facilitate the development of web applications, databases, message services, etc. the application
                of Java EE uses the same virtual machine as Java SE.
            </p>
            <p>
                Java ME is different from Java SE. It is a "slimming version" for embedded devices. The standard library
                of Java SE cannot be used on java ME. The virtual machine of java ME is also a "slimming version".</p>
            <p>There is no doubt that Java SE is the core of the entire Java platform, and Java EE is necessary for
                further learning web applications. The familiar frameworks like spring are part of the Java EE open
                source ecosystem. Unfortunately, java ME has never really become popular. Instead, Android development
                has become one of the standards for mobile platforms. Therefore, there is no special need to learn java
                ME</p>
            <p id="jdk">When beginners start learn Java, they often hear JDK and JRE. What exactly are they?</p>
            <div class="li">
                <li>
                    JDK：Java Development Kit
                </li>
                <li> JRE：Java Runtime Environment</li>
            </div>
            <p>In short, JRE is a virtual machine running Java bytecode. However, if you only have the java source code,
                you
                need JDK to compile it into Java bytecode, because JDK not only contains JRE, but also provides
                compiler, debugger and other development tools.</p>
            <p>their relationship is as follows:</p>
